Description: Whole-program optimizing compiler for Standard ML
 MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for Standard ML.  MLton
 generates small executables with excellent runtime performance,
 utilizing untagged and unboxed native integers, reals, and words,
 unboxed native arrays, fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic based on
 GnuMP, and multiple code generation and garbage collection strategies.
 In addition, MLton provides a feature rich Standard ML programming
 environment, with full support for SML97 as given in The Definition
 of Standard ML (Revised), a number of useful language extensions, a
 complete implementation of the Standard ML Basis Library, various
 useful libraries, a simple and fast C foreign function interface, the
 ML Basis system for programming with source libraries, and tools such
 as a lexer generator, a parser generator, and a profiler.
 .
 This metapackage depends on all MLton packages.
